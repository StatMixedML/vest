# VEST 
## Vector of Statistics from Time Series

This package/project contains a set of tools for automatic feature engineering for time series forecasting problems.
This is an early version complementary to ongoing publication (under peer review)

In order to understand how vest works you can go through the experiments within "experiments" folder, which already contains a dummy example.
